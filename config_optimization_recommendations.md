# Configuration Optimization for ReAct Agent Upgrade

## Summary
The current `prompts.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files are **compatible** with the BaseAgent upgrade to ReAct, but some enhancements can optimize performance.

## Current Status ✅
- **prompts.yaml**: Compatible - role definitions work with ReAct
- **tasks.yaml**: Compatible - task structures work with upgraded agents
- **No breaking changes required**

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced ReAct Prompt Templates (Optional)

The current `tools_instruction` sections could be enhanced to explicitly mention ReAct reasoning patterns:

```yaml
# Example enhancement for researcher role
general_researcher:
  tools_instruction: |
    Execute research following the ReAct framework: Think → Act → Observe → Reflect.
    
    **Reasoning Process:**
    1. **Thought**: Analyze what information is needed
    2. **Action**: Choose the appropriate tool and operation
    3. **Action Input**: Provide specific parameters
    4. **Observation**: Review the tool's output
    5. **Reflection**: Determine if more actions are needed
    
    **Available Tools:**
    - research: Use for systematic information gathering
    - scraper: Use for web data collection
    - classifier: Use for content analysis
```

### 2. ReAct-Optimized Task Definitions (Optional)

Tasks could include explicit ReAct guidance:

```yaml
# Example enhancement for system tasks
parse_intent:
  description: "Analyze user input using ReAct reasoning to provide comprehensive intent parsing"
  agent: "intent_parser"
  expected_output: "JSON object with analysis_summary, reasoning_steps, and primary_intent"
  reasoning_guidance: |
    Use ReAct framework:
    1. Think about the user's underlying intent
    2. Act by analyzing the input systematically
    3. Observe patterns and categories
    4. Reflect on completeness before finalizing
```

### 3. Error Handling Instructions (Recommended)

Since the new ReAct implementation includes `handle_parsing_errors=True`, add guidance:

```yaml
# Add to system_prompt or individual roles
error_handling_guidance: |
  **Error Recovery with ReAct:**
  - If an action fails, think about alternative approaches
  - Use the observation to understand what went wrong
  - Adjust your reasoning and try a different action
  - Always provide a final answer even if some actions fail
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Recommended)
1. **Add error handling guidance** - Leverages the new `handle_parsing_errors=True` feature
2. **Test current configurations** - Ensure compatibility with upgraded agents

### Medium Priority (Optional)
1. **Enhance tools_instruction** - Make ReAct reasoning explicit
2. **Add reasoning_guidance** - Help agents follow ReAct patterns

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
1. **Create ReAct-specific templates** - For new agent types
2. **Add performance metrics** - Track ReAct reasoning quality

## Conclusion

**No immediate changes required** - the current configuration files work with the upgraded BaseAgent. The enhancements above are **optimizations** that can improve ReAct reasoning quality and error handling.

The upgrade successfully maintains backward compatibility while providing the foundation for enhanced ReAct-based reasoning.
